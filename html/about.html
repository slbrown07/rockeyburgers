            <h1>About Rockey Burgers</h1>
            <h2>Slogan: Best Quality Burgers in town. Off the charts.</h2> 
        </div>
        <article>
            <p>Step into any ROCKEY BURGERS, and you’ll notice we’re different.
            From our famous (free) house-made pickles, to the hand-painted signage, 
            to our cheerful staff, we build our restaurants like we build our 
            burgers–sustainably, locally, and with an unwavering commitment to quality. </p>

            <p>Fresh, quality produce, meat, dairy and buns, sourced from partners 
            located just miles from our restaurants, are the ingredients to making the 
            perfect burger. This commitment to creating the best possible food for our 
            guests is a direct reflection of our promise of creating fast food burgers 
            using slow food values.</p>

            <aside>Bite into any Super burger, and taste the difference. Our burgers, fries, 
            and shakes are made with the finest, freshest ingredients available. </aside>

            <p>All our beef is Rockey Farms, humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed, ground 
            fresh daily, and sourced from a family-owned ranch. </p>
                
            <p>All of our shakes and cones are made with organic cream from Rockey Creamery, a small, family-owned, 
            organic farm located South of Nephi, Utah.</p>

            <p>Our buns are baked to our specification by an artisan baker in Nephi, UT </p>

            <p>The potatoes we use to make our French fries are made from potatoes grown 
            in North America by growers who are required to identify the genetic source of 
            their seed potatoes. We do not work with genetically modified potato varieties. 
            Our potatoes are processed fresh off the field and delivered to us without any 
            modifications. We proudly serve Sir Kensington ketchup. </p>
